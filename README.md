# 🗑️🤖 Smart Dustbin Using IoT

## 📌 Overview
The Smart Dustbin Using IoT is an intelligent waste management system designed to monitor garbage levels in real time using sensors and automation. The system helps prevent dustbin overflow and supports efficient waste collection, contributing to cleaner and smarter cities.

---

## ✨ Features
- Automatic garbage level detection  
- Real-time monitoring using sensors  
- Alert/indication when dustbin is full  
- Low-cost and easy-to-implement system  
- Suitable for smart cities and public places  

---

## 🛠️ Components Used
- Microcontroller (Arduino / NodeMCU)
- Ultrasonic / IR Sensor
- LED / Buzzer (Alert system)
- Power supply
- Connecting wires
- Dustbin setup

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. The sensor continuously measures the garbage level inside the dustbin.
2. The microcontroller processes the sensor data.
3. When the garbage level reaches a predefined threshold:
   - An alert is generated (LED/Buzzer).
4. This helps authorities take timely action for waste collection.
